adjust class_file so that Utf8_info parses the weird custom utf8 encoding.
  current idea: read u1{count} and re-parse that as custom_utf8_codepoint{_}

todo: ensure that
  foo := a\A:(a\A:(a\A:byte{a}){a}){a}

has each a scoped properly

figure out how to handle mutually recursive rules
  and locally recursive...

a := b:0
b := a:1

causes a stack overflow

  when fixed: tack on
    | annotation_value | array_value
  to element_value rule


other issue;
a := a:1

does definitely cause stack overflow. not ok.



solve character weirdness with rattler not reading "@" and "[" right...
