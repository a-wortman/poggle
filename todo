adjust class_file so that Utf8_info parses the weird custom utf8 encoding.
  current idea: read u1{count} and re-parse that as custom_utf8_codepoint{_}

todo: ensure that
  foo := a\A:(a\A:(a\A:byte{a}){a}){a}

has each a scoped properly

add support for warning/verification steps.
  semantic checks like x := u2 #{ x\ -> class_info[x] & class_info[x].tag == foo }
